Would I have the same issue with these Snapdragon laptops? Considering that their performance is better but gpu underwhelming.. \ud83e\udd14",

The Samsung Notes application is a brilliant bit of work and adds a lot of value to the Samsung brand.  Without 2-in-1 capability, the Samsung Notes app for handwriting is useless on their laptops.  It isn't as though Samsung would have to reinvent new tech.  They already had the chassis, hinge and software.  All they had to do was deliver the 2-in-1 competitive edge that would have made their Snapdragon offering a must have, particularly for those already invested in the Samsung ecosystem.    As it stands, I skipped the Samsung offering and went with the 13\" Microsoft Surface laptop.   Great device and would be even better if I could use Microsoft Journal.  Sadly, while the Microsoft laptop is a very high quality device, it suffers the same handwriting limitation as all of the other Snapdragon devices.",

The small critiques i would have are that perhaps she can project a little more; her voice trails off just a little at the end of a sentence; and she goes a little fast when talking about technical things like computer specs.  With that said, she is an outstanding communicator, is very engaging and her appreciation for technology just bleeds through (you can't fake that).

You can always put your Mac Book Pro on the blazing Phoenix sidewalk and watch it turn into liquid metal. I'm surprised you don\u2019t get the Asus two and one instead of the Microsoft though Microsoft makes a quality laptop, but for a secondary laptop it's more flexible, Youcan use it for more preformant tasks and don\u2019t have app limitations and you can game on it. Maybe a little more therapy will help \ud83d\ude0a",

There are ultrabook computers with real chips inside x86 that can do much more for the same money and there is no way that ARM chip can surpass them, primarily because of the software support in the form of programs.

Maybe AMD needs better tuning or drivers to improve the efficiency during light tasks on Windows. \n\nGiven these useful graphs, I would expect a video that compares the processors with each other in terms of battery life and performance at different power levels. With this efficiency of the new Ryzen AI processors, going for Snapdragon may not be worth due to its compatibility issues and low graphics performance. What's also important is that, the Snapdragon processors may slow down GUI animations, scrolling, or window management operations (like the Task View) when multiple high-resolution monitors are used.",

Laptops that have an Option to disable Optimus and use the Dedicated GPU like RTX 3060 and above  Can run more demanding games without being plugged in the wall with the power chord. (It can be a problem because it switches from integrated to Dedicated Automatically when you dont want to for example: \nOculus Air Link app for PC doesnt recognize the Dedicated GPU rtx 3050 ti and uses the integrated graphics of the processor (even when plugged in) since Optimus manages that Directly and you cant do anything, unless your Laptop supports manual control of it,which gives horrible performance when trying to use the Headset unless using the cable directly )",

Thankfully, I was able to return it before the return period expired, but it sucks bc it was a beautiful looking laptop and I was really excited for my first alienware laptop. Now I have the tools to make a more informed decision regarding my next laptop. If you can, please do a more in-depth video expanding on what you've already done in this one, thanks!",

This means that current Macbooks are not, although reviewers suggest, equally worth comparing to other devices.\n\n- If devices have fans, their cleaning must be easy or I do not buy them.\n\n- Batteries must have easy replacement, acceptable prices and manufacturer statements on long availability. Otherwise, I do not buy any device other than cheap ones.\n\n- Keyboards must provide a typing experience similar to a mechanical desktop keyboard. Whenever, however, I try countless keyboards of mobile devices in stores, even the best ones are unacceptable crap. I cannot use such. Maybe Cherry MX Low Profile would be acceptable but I cannot know because such is never shown in stores here and some manufacturers only offer it with US layout while I need German layout.\n\n- Ergonomics includes ordinarily sized arrow keys and four page navigation keys. Keyboards without such I do not buy.\n\nAlthough the mining and Corona crisis prevented me from building an RTX 3000 desktop, above criteria meant that no mobile device was acceptable. With a 3 years delay, I built an RTX 4000 desktop. Seeing current mobile devices, nothing has changed - they are still unacceptable because of not fulfilling above criteria. If this state of the market continues, I will upgade my desktop instead of buying a mobile device. All those comparison reviews are immaterial as long as not all of my essential criteria above are fulfilled. You reviewers act on the assumption that there would be some mobile devices worth buying. This is not the case for users like me who have to resort to desktops despite their disadvantage of immobility. --robert jasiek",

Next Christmas I'm giving out 3 Christmas presents to friends of mine. I found a place where you can get refurbished ones (in great condition) for just over $400. Which is still well worth it today for sure. I've seen cheaper but not in as good of shape and not as trustworthy a seller. Also a big reason to buy Apple over any other Windows POS is because despite Apple being woke, they're nothing compared to communist Bill Gates whose company wokeness knows no bounds...and thus must be eradicated like other evil companies such as Disney. However, I will say this much I'm tired of seeing these awful wallpapers of Apple in their OS's, I had my friend go through the hard work of 'hacking' my iPhone just to delete them forever from my phone, so I wouldn't have to see them and their agenda they carry.",

All my videos are in FullHD or even less. In our country all TV show are in that resolution. SnapDragon speed is amazing but FullHD or 720p are not so good on 3K displays. I found that some 4K videos look better on just FullHD. Same is on Apple systems. I thought i ll switch (after 30 y of Win) but new Surface works and feels so damn good. I know they never be in just FullHD, so maybe some day SnapDragon will be. Its ok, I have 2y old Yoga and it is fine, just the fan noise is killing me. Maybe I was to long but I think that fan noise and resolution are important factors. My old concert videos look kind a shitty on 3K or even 2K.",

                "comment": "I don't agree with what was said about the Macbook Air being the best general choice. I just looked into getting one, and it's such an obscene, obsolete product I think. The base price is high to begin with, and the default configuration of 8GB RAM and 256GB storage is nothing else than a complete insult, with upgrade prices being a downright robbery. So, for 1600-1800 dollars/euros you end up with a product that has 16GB RAM, only 512GB storage, with a soldered SSD that can brick your device easily, combined with a 60 Hz LCD display. That's a lot of compromises for a somewhat longer battery life. Meanwhile competing laptops offer similar build quality, 16GB RAM in the base config, 120Hz OLED screen, replaceable/uprgradeable SSD, perhaps even 2-in-1 functionality, at a significantly lower price.",

It has its flaws for sure, and is far from being a perfect laptop. BUT, for my purposes and life as of right this second, having two screens on the go is simply an undeniable form-factor win that I couldn't say no to it.",

Obviously, if you're a rich git and change laptops every year, feel free to ignore my tip \ud83d\ude0a",
